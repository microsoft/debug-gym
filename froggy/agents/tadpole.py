    Tadpole is a simple hierarchical agent that consists of a task decomposition module and a command generation module.
    The task decomposition module is responsible for determining the current subgoal (e.g., what are we trying to investigate now?).
    Guided by the subgoal, the command generation module generates a command towards achieving the subgoal.
    In such way, the command generation module can focus on generating a command that is relevant to the current subgoal.
