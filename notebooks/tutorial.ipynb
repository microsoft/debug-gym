    "| `eval` | It runs the current code repository using the provided entrypoint (e.g., pytest), and returns the terminal's output (e.g., error message). |\n",
    "| `pdb` | Interactive debugger wrapping the [Python pdb tool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html). In additon, users can choose to maintain a set of persistent breakpoints (as in some programming IDEs), which are not reset after every eval. With such feature, a new pdb debugging session is activated automatically, with all the breakpoints restored. Note such breakpoint can be cleared by pdb commands such as `cl`. |\n",
